					<div class="showcase-item-filler"><img class="blank-halfcard"></div>
				</div>
				<p class="minor-text"><b>Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord</b>, the defensive mainstay of Galaxy,</b> has countless unique interactions to discuss. To start, Photon Lord has three effects:</p>
				<ol>
					<li class="minor-text">If this card has a "Photon" card as material, it cannot be destroyed by card effects.</li>
					<li class="minor-text">When an opponent's monster activates its effect (Quick Effect): You can detach 1 material from this card; negate that monster's effect, and if the detached material was a "Galaxy" card, destroy that card.</li>
					<li class="minor-text">During your opponent's turn (Quick Effect): You can take 1 "Photon" or "Galaxy" card from your Deck, and either add it to your hand or attach it to this card as material.</li>
				</ol>
				<h2 class="header-text">The Materials</h2>
				<p class="minor-text">The materials you make Lord with matter. It wants at least one Photon and one Galaxy; one for protection and one to destroy what it negates. <b>Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon</b> fulfills both needs at once; so does the xyz monster <b>Galaxy Photon Dragon</b> which can be ranked up into Lord by using <b>Eternal Galaxy</b>.</p>
				<p class="minor-text">While you should strive to make Lord with one Photon and one Galaxy, it may not always be possible. <span class="major-text">In a pinch, Lord can use its third effect to attach better materials to itself.</span> If it is missing a Photon, it can attach one in response to an effect like <b>Raigeki</b>. If it is missing a Galaxy, it can attach one in the Draw Phase before the opponent activates any monster effects. Notably - if you know there is an important monster in the opponent's Extra Deck to steal with <b>Galaxy Hundred</b> like <b>Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir</b>, and have no other way to trigger it - you can attach <b>Galaxy-Eyes Afterglow Dragon</b> to provide one.</p>
				<p class="minor-text">Should you require it, there are options to attach that go plus, potentially offsetting the lack of a search.</p>
				<ol>
					<li class="minor-text"><i>Photon Jumper</i>: Searches a Spell or Trap upon hitting the GY.</li>
					<li class="minor-text"><i>Photon Emperor</i>: Summons itself and grants a bonus normal summon upon hitting the GY.</li>
					<li class="minor-text"><i>Galaxy-Eyes Afterglow Dragon</i>: Summons a Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon from the hand or deck when detached, which can trigger Galaxy Hundred.</li>
					<li class="minor-text"><i>Galaxy Cyclone</i>: Can be banished from the GY to destroy a face-up Spell or Trap card.</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="minor-text">Finally, in some grind scenarios, the attach effect can replenish the negates of a Lord without material. This can even refill a Lord summoned from the GY with the effect of <b>Galaxy Summoner</b>.</p>
				<h2 class="header-text">The Search</h2>
				<p class="minor-text">While the attach effect can be handy, adding any card to hand on your opponent's turn is far more common. The three use cases are searching a <b>Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon</b> as discard fodder for <b>Galaxy-Eyes Solflare Dragon</b>, searching a follow-up play for the next turn, and in rare scenarios, searching an archetypal hand trap like <b>Photon Jumper</b>.</p>
				<p class="major-text">If given the option, is it better to use Lord's search on discard fodder or follow-up?</p>
				<p class="minor-text">While the answer is usually, <i>"search whichever you don't have, or if you have neither, wait and see"</i>, there is more to it. Consider the following scenario:</p>
				<p class="major-text">Your end board is <b>Lord</b> and <b>Solflare</b>. With Solflare's effect, you have the choice of adding follow-up (<b>Galaxy Wizard / Summoner</b>) or discard fodder (<b>Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon</b>) to your hand. Which is the right choice?</p>
				<p class="minor-text"><i>Usually the best choice is to keep follow-up</i>; if both Lord and Solflare are crushed by a surprise board breaker before the search, having follow-up already secured is better. But if you have knowledge of the opponent's deck or know they are siding against you, it goes deeper.</p>
				<p class="minor-text">Some reasons to keep follow-up and use Lord's search on discard fodder:</p>
				<ol>
					<li class="minor-text">Gives you comeback potential if your entire board is outed or negated before the search.</li>
					<li class="minor-text">If your opponent does not do anything that warrants a Solflare pop and instead sets cards, you can search additional follow-up or backrow disruption during the End Phase.</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="minor-text">Some reasons to keep follow-up and use Lord's search on discard fodder:</p>
				<ol>
					<li class="minor-text">Preserves more copies of Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon in your deck, which can be important for resolving both Solflare's discard and <b>Galaxy-Hundred's</b> trigger, unless you have <b>Starliege Photon Blast Dragon</b> to reuse one. It can also help third turn Afterglow plays.</li>
					<li class="minor-text">If you know the opponent has cards which punish monster effects or on-field effects, searching <b>Galaxy Trance</b> off Lord makes a harder to interrupt play than summoning a monster added off Solflare.</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="minor-text">This is just the surface. Making educated guesses on what kind of disruption the opponent is playng, such as <b>Kaijus</b>, <b>Dark Ruler No More</b>, or <b>Kurikara Divincarnate</b>, affects the answer as well. On that note...</p>
				<h2 class="header-text">The Timing</h2>
				<p class="minor-text">Photon Lord's search can occur any time on the opponent's turn. <span class="major-text">Depending on what you predict is in the opponent's hand, the ideal moment changes.</span> This tests your knowledge of the metagame.</p>
				<p class="minor-text">Reasons to search in the Draw Phase:</p>
				<ol>
					<li class="minor-text">Immediately makes Solflare's pop live if it is not already, which can help against monsters with on-summon effects. Also ensures Solflare is live even if the opponent has a <b>Kaiju</b> for Photon Lord.</li>
					<li class="minor-text">Delays the period until <b>Triple Tactics Talent</b> is live.</li>
					<li class="minor-text">Ensures your search before spell speed 1 board breakers like <b>Dark Ruler No More</b>.</li>
					<li class="minor-text">Does not enable Droll & Lock Bird, which can help if <b>Photon Jumper</b> is present to provide another search later in the turn.</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="minor-text">Reasons to search immediately after using Lord's negate:</p>
				<ol>
					<li class="minor-text">Secures a search before Lord can be tributed by <b>Kurikara Divincarnate</b>.</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="minor-text">Reasons to to wait as long as possible:</p>
				<ol>
					<li class="minor-text">Allows you to react to the situation and search the ideal follow-up card rather than guessing.</li>
					<li class="minor-text">Keeps your opponent in the dark about your hand, and can surprise them by fetching Solflare discard fodder.</li>
					<li class="minor-text">Allows you to search even if the opponent has <b>Infinite Impermanence</b> or similar interruption they can chain to Lord's negate. <b>Psy-Framegear Gamma</b> can also be avoided as well.</li>
					<li class="minor-text">Can add <b>Photon Jumper</b> or <b>Galakuriboh</b> to handle unexpected Battle Phase emergencies.</li>
					<li class="minor-text">Delays the period until <b>Triple Tactics Thrust</b> is live and can avoid it entirely by searching during the End Phase if no monster effects were used.</li>
				</ol>
				<h2 class="header-text">The Transformation</h2>
				<div class="showcase">
					<div class="showcase-item"><img class="armor-full"></div>
					<div class="showcase-item"><img class="blade-full"></div>
				</div>
				<p class="minor-text">Though it may be a sturdy wall, Photon Lord can be ranked up into <b>Galaxy-Eyes Full Armor Photon Dragon</b> or <b>Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Blade Dragon</b> to transition to offense during your turn. This is not only an effective way make a push, but also to detach materials like <b>Photon Emperor</b> or load the GY.</p>
				<p class="minor-text bottom-space">Of course, the commitment this option takes - losing all the protective effects of Lord - is not to be taken lightly. Awareness is key when choosing the moment to overlay.

			<div class="article-div">
				<p class="minor-text">We suggest to side 1 copy of <a href="https://www.galaxy-eyes.de/images/full/77098449.jpg" target="_blank">Galaxy Wave</a>
						as an option to win in time. An easy way to use it to win in time would be the following (Nibiru-proof) combo:
			</p> 
			<p class="minor-text"></p>
			<p class="minor-text">Hand: Soldier + Jumper</p>
			<p class="minor-text">1. dump jumper to special soilder</p>
			<p class="minor-text">2. soldier searches summoner and jumper searches galaxy wave</p>
			<p class="minor-text">3. normal summon summoner and revive jumper</p>
			<p class="minor-text">4. activate galaxy wave</p>
			<p class="minor-text">5. summoner and jumper into GPD</p>
			<p class="minor-text">6. Wave burns 500</p>
			<p class="minor-text">7. GPD detach summoner search eternal galaxy</p>
			<p class="minor-text"></p>
			<p class="minor-text">On top of that you can use Lord to search another copy of jumper to prevent the opponent from attacking (and inflicting damage) by using jumpers second effect.</p>
